Contents:
- Each folder contains time series recordings of a single 128-channel EEG experiment.

- Within a single folder, there is a ".set" file which contains relevent information about the experiment (sample rate, number of points, where events occur, etc). 

- The files which have a prefix "raw" are the recordings of scalp potentials for a single EEG channels. 

- The files which have a prefix "ica" are the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) activations for single ICA components. I include a paper on ICA as it relates to EEG analysis. 

- "file_list.txt" contains a complete library of each file and its location in the file system. It may be useful for distributing the data.
